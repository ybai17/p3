yileib p3 grade: 62/61
Graded revision 64

Graded by: GLK

#cksm = 3/3 (any modifications flagged by cksum messages)

#data = 20/20 (seems to do something/anything to visualize data)

#past = 4/4 (avoided needless copypasta)
#cmnt = 4/4 (code has comments to document its working)
  great commenting

#time = 4/4 (timeline slider works)
#scpl = 4/4 (scatterplot per-state circles show data)
#warp = 4/4 (warpings in scatterplot enable ordinal judgements)
#stco = 4/4 (US states are colored to show data)
#purp = 3/3 (PUR colormap judiciously uses purple)
  very sparingly but ok
#lvac = 2.5/3 (LVA colormap useful)
  a little too much gray in the middle, given the task
#tool = 5.5/4 (tool tips with mouseover, linking map + scatterplot)
  great tooltips!  colorcoded table, and blinking circle; super cool!
#tran = 4/4 (smooth transitions in states, beams, scatterplot circles)

GLK regrets that there's likely no time for regrades, but if there is something
totally broken and wrong about the grading, do write a private note on EdStem.
